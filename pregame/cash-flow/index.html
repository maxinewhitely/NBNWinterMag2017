            <p class="lead">Thanks to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, every time you donate to any political candidate or political action committee, the world will know about it – if they’re creepy, bored or curious enough to look. Fortunately, NBN is all of those things, so we examined the political donation habits of some of Northwestern’s most prominent faculty members, alumni and professors. A quick trip to the Federal Election Commission’s website told us all that we needed to know ... and much, much more.</p>
